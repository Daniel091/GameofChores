# About the App
Game of Chores introduces a clever way of organising household tasks easily. 
First, create a new community or join an existing one by entering the respective ID. It is as simple as that.
Then, create a task, assign a responsible person and a due date.
Decide if the task is one time only or if it should be repeated daily, weekly, monthly or annually.
Avoid doing the same tasks over and over alone by adding rotation amongst all household members.
Gain points for all finished chores.
With these points you can gamble and gain even more points, in order to become member of the month and be celebrated by the app and of course â€“ your flat mates!
